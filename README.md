# **DATA ANALYSIS ON AVIATION ACCIDENTS (1919-2023)**

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

Using data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization to generate insights for a business stakeholder.

# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

A company wants to join the aviation industry. Since they have no knowledge on the potential risks of aircrafts, I need to analyse data from the past ongoings with aircrafts for them, get the best aircraft with less shortcomings and the best manufacturer for the company.

  ## KEY BUSINESS QUESTIONS

   * Which operator has the least accidents caused?
   * What type of aircraft has the least accidents?
   * Which region contributes to the few accidents?
   * What type of aircrafts are to be avoided by the company?
   * How are the locations affecting the aircrafts?

 * Year → The year that the accident took place.
 * Type → Model of the aircraft.
 * Operator → The handler of the aircraft
 * Location → Place of accident.

   Douglas C-47A (DC-3) recorded the highest number of accidents since it was one of the most important aircraft of the World War II therefore often used.

  The high accident rate between 1940 and 1945 was due to the World War II
  

# CONCLUSION

The high accident rate between 1940 and 1945 was due to the World War II. This explains why the United States Airforce (USAF) and United States Army Airforce (USAAF) had the highest number of accidents since the United States actively Participated in the WorldWar. The aircraft Douglas C-47A (DC-3) recorded the highest number of accidents since it was one of the most important aircraft of the World War II therefore often used.
